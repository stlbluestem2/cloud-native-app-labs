## What You Will Learn

* How to use Ribbon as a client side load balancer
* How to use a Ribbon enabled `RestTemplate`

## Exercises


### Start the  `config-server`,  `service-registry`, and `fortune-service`

1) Start the `config-server` in a terminal window.  You may have terminal windows still open from previous labs.  They may be reused for this lab.

```bash
$ cd $CLOUD_NATIVE_APP_LABS_HOME/config-server
$ mvn clean spring-boot:run
```

2) Start the `service-registry`

```bash
$ cd $CLOUD_NATIVE_APP_LABS_HOME/service-registry
$ mvn clean spring-boot:run
```

3) Start the `fortune-service`

```bash
$ cd $CLOUD_NATIVE_APP_LABS_HOME/fortune-service
$ mvn clean spring-boot:run
```

### Set up `greeting-ribbon`

***No additions to the pom.xml***

In this case, we don't need to explicitly include Ribbon support in the `pom.xml`.  Ribbon support is pulled in through transitive dependencies (dependencies of the dependencies we have already defined).

1) Review the the following file: `$CLOUD_NATIVE_APP_LABS_HOME/greeting-ribbon/src/main/java/io/pivotal/greeting/GreetingController.java`.  Notice the `loadBalancerClient`.  It is a client side load balancer (ribbon).  Review the `fetchFortuneServiceUrl()` method.  Ribbon is integrated with Eureka so that it can discover services as well.  Notice how the `loadBalancerClient` chooses a service instance by name.

```java
@Controller
public class GreetingController {

	Logger logger = LoggerFactory
			.getLogger(GreetingController.class);




	@Autowired
	private LoadBalancerClient loadBalancerClient;

	@RequestMapping("/")
	String getGreeting(Model model){

		logger.debug("Adding greeting");
		model.addAttribute("msg", "Greetings!!!");


		RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
        String fortune = restTemplate.getForObject(fetchFortuneServiceUrl(), String.class);

		logger.debug("Adding fortune");
		model.addAttribute("fortune", fortune);

		//resolves to the greeting.vm velocity template
		return "greeting";
	}

	private String fetchFortuneServiceUrl() {
	    ServiceInstance instance = loadBalancerClient.choose("fortune-service");

	    logger.debug("uri: {}",instance.getUri().toString());
	    logger.debug("serviceId: {}", instance.getServiceId());


	    return instance.getUri().toString();
	}

}

```



2) Open a new terminal window.  Start the `greeting-ribbon` app.

 ```bash
$ cd $CLOUD_NATIVE_APP_LABS_HOME/greeting-ribbon
$ mvn clean spring-boot:run
```

3) After the a few moments, check the `service-registry` [dashboard](http://localhost:8761).  Confirm the `greeting-ribbon` app is registered.


4) [Browse](http://localhost:8080/) to the `greeting-ribbon` application.  Confirm you are seeing fortunes.  Refresh as desired.  Also review the terminal output for the `greeting-ribbon` app.  See the `uri` and `serviceId` being logged.

5) Stop the `greeting-ribbon` application.

### Set up `greeting-ribbon-rest`

***No additions to the pom.xml***

In this case, we don't need to explicitly include Ribbon support in the `pom.xml`.  Ribbon support is pulled in through transitive dependencies (dependencies of the dependencies we have already defined).

1) Review the the following file: `$CLOUD_NATIVE_APP_LABS_HOME/greeting-ribbon-rest/src/main/java/io/pivotal/greeting/GreetingController.java`.  Notice the `RestTemplate`.  It is not the usual `RestTemplate`, it is load balanced by Ribbon.  The `@LoadBalanced` annotation is a qualifier to ensure we get the load balanced `RestTemplate` injected.  This further simplifies application code.

```java
@Controller
public class GreetingController {

	Logger logger = LoggerFactory
			.getLogger(GreetingController.class);




	@Autowired
	@LoadBalanced
	private RestTemplate restTemplate;

	@RequestMapping("/")
	String getGreeting(Model model){

		logger.debug("Adding greeting");
		model.addAttribute("msg", "Greetings!!!");


  	String fortune = restTemplate.getForObject("http://fortune-service", String.class);

		logger.debug("Adding fortune");
		model.addAttribute("fortune", fortune);

		//resolves to the greeting.vm velocity template
		return "greeting";
	}


}

```

2) Open a new terminal window.  Start the `greeting-ribbon-rest` app.

 ```bash
$ cd $CLOUD_NATIVE_APP_LABS_HOME/greeting-ribbon-rest
$ mvn clean spring-boot:run
```

3) After the a few moments, check the `service-registry` [dashboard](http://localhost:8761).  Confirm the `greeting-ribbon-rest` app is registered.


4) [Browse](http://localhost:8080/) to the `greeting-ribbon-rest` application.  Confirm you are seeing fortunes.  Refresh as desired.  Also review the terminal output for the `greeting-ribbon-rest` app.

5) When done stop the `config-server`, `service-registry`, `fortune-service` and `greeting-ribbon-rest` applications.

### Deploy the `greeting-ribbon-rest` to PCF

1) Package, push, bind services and set environment variables for `greeting-ribbon-rest`.

```
$ mvn clean package
$ cf push greeting-ribbon-rest -p target/greeting-ribbon-rest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar -m 512M --random-route --no-start
$ cf bind-service greeting-ribbon-rest config-server
$ cf bind-service greeting-ribbon-rest service-registry
$ cf set-env greeting-ribbon-rest SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE dev
$ cf start greeting-ribbon-rest
```
You can safely ignore the _TIP: Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect_ message from the CLI. We can just start the `greeting-ribbon-rest` application.

2) After the a few moments, check the `service-registry`.  Confirm the `greeting-ribbon-rest` app is registered.

3) Refresh the `greeting-ribbon-rest` `/` endpoint.

**Note About This Lab**

Because services (e.g. `fortune-service`) are exposing their `hostname` as the first Cloud Foundry URI (see [Service Discovery Lab](../spring-cloud-netflix-service-discovery/sc-oss.md#update-app-config-for-fortune-service-and-greeting-service-to-run-on-pcf)) this means that requests to them are being routed through the `router` and subsequently load balanced at that layer.  Therefore, client side load balancing doesn't occur.  

Pivotal Cloud Foundry has recently added support for allowing cross container communication.  This will allow applications to communicate with each other without passing through the `router`.  As applied to client-side load balancing, services such as `fortune-service` would register with Eureka using their container IP addresses.  Allowing clients to reach them without going through the `router`.
